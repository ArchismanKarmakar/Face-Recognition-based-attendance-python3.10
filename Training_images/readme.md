- Add images of each person you want to recognise to a folder by their name in `Training_images`.

    Example
    ```bash
    $ mkdir Training_images
    $ cd Training_images
    ```
    Then copy all the images of that person in `./Training_images/Name_Of_Person` folder.

    ![Id_Person_Name](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92569441/165980616-66343df6-9272-43f6-a568-6c6fd0e74a82.png)

    This will create `encoded-images-data.csv` file.


    Note: The name of two persons can not be same. If it is same, then it will not work.
