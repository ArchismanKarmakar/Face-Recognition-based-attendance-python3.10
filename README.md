## Installation :key:

#### Download or Clone the project

Download using GitHub Desktop

or

You can clone the project with git bash.To clone the project using git bash first open the git bash and write the following code
```

[ **Notice: During the package installization, sometime it shows some error, to avoid those error you can install those packages as admin. ]

## Test Run :bicyclist:

After creating the enviroment and installing the packages, open the IDE terminal/command line to run the program. Using the code below.

```
py main.py
```
Here is a demo to run the program. I'm Using the Pycharm IDE in my demo.

This project have some bugs.

* <strike>Student Details: In student details folder the **StudentDetails.csv** file don't have ID & name column.This problem show when the program run first time and create the <stong>StudentDetails.csv</strong> file automatically.
